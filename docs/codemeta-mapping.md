# Using Codemeta to feed the NumPEx Software Catalog
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Draft-orange?style=for-the-badge)

**NumPEx Software Catalog** is a living list software projects adhering to the [NumPEx software integration guidelines](https://numpex-pc5.gitlabpages.inria.fr/tutorials/projects/guidelines/index.html). Each project is described very briefly by:
- A name,
- A short description,
- A link to the documentation,
- A link to an open discussion channel,
- Links to Guix and/or Spack package recipes 

The present document gives recommendations to create the Codemeta file for your project so that it can be automatically imported into the Software Catalog. In particular the document defines a convention to map Codemeta properties to the NumPEx catalog properties in an uniform & consistent way across all projects.
